<hi id="heading">Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes a part of his or her surplus income for the fulfilment of the needs of those who are less capable. The majority of NGOs has experienced difficulties in getting funds or other required things. Getting donor is a very hard task, and sometime dealing with some donorâ€™s conditions can be a big challenge for NGOs to fulfil it. This charity management system will help NGOs to find donors easily.</hi>	<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/03/01/04/44/donate-654328_960_720.png" width="300 px" height="400 px" id="small">
